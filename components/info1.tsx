          HackMCST is an annual 12-hour hackathon at Morris County School of Technology hosted by the Computer and Information Sciences Academy. 
          Students from grades 7 to 12 are given the opportunity to build, or "hack together", various apps, videogames, networks, or even robots! 
          The event is 100% free (provided you bring your own technology), and lunch, dinner, and snacks are provided at no extra cost. 
          Various workshops are held each year for hackers of all skill levels to learn new things, and final projects are judged at the end of the night, 
          with the best projects winning various prizes!
